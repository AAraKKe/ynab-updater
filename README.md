# Indexa Updater: Swiftly Sync Your Real-World Balances with YNAB!

Tired of manually updating account balances in YNAB to reflect the *real* world? Wish you could just... sync them quickly from one place?

**Gain control and save time with Indexa Updater!** âœ¨

Indexa Updater is your dedicated desktop assistant for bridging the gap between your actual account balances and your YNAB budget. Built with the modern [Textualize](https://textualize.io/) framework, it offers a clean, efficient interface right in your terminal.

**Why Indexa Updater?**

* **Single Pane of Glass:** View and update balances for *multiple* accounts all at once. No more clicking through each account individually in YNAB!
* **Automatic Adjustments:** Indexa Updater automatically creates adjustment transactions in your YNAB accounts to match the current real-world balance. This is especially powerful for keeping [YNAB Tracking Accounts](https://docs.youneedabudget.com/category/131-tracking-accounts) (like investments) up-to-date.
* **Speedy Updates:** Update all acount balances in YNAB automatically adding any correction needed using the YNAB public [API](https://api.ynab.com/).
* **Your Data Stays Yours:** We believe your financial data is yours alone. Indexa Updater runs entirely on *your* computer. No cloud accounts, no online storage â€“ your information remains private and local. ðŸ”’

**Important Note on Connectivity:**

Indexa Updater relies on connections to financial institutions via APIs. It can only connect to institutions that provide an API accessible to individual users. It **cannot** connect to banks or other institutions that do not offer such an API.
